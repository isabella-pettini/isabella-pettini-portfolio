## Useage

This portfolio is broken down into three sections: About Me, Work, and Contact. The About Me has a brief description, work history, some hobbies and likes. The Work section has 2 past projects and a ‘Coming Soon’ placeholder to add more projects as they are completed. The contact section at this time, is not linked anywhere as professional pages have not been made at this time. This portfolio is a starting point for a future career in web development and a good place to document progress in the coming months.
